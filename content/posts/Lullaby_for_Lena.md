In the soft moonlight's gentle glow,
Close your eyes, my Lena, and let go,
As the stars twinkle in the night,
May sweet dreams fill your sight.

Rest your head upon the pillow,
Let go of all your worries, my willow,
Know that I am by your side,
As you peacefully in slumber abide.

So drift off now, my dearest one,
Underneath the quiet moon and sun,
May angels guard you through the night,
Until the morning brings its light.

Goodnight, Lena, my precious love,
Sleep tight, with blessings from above.
