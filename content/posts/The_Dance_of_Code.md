In the realm of pixels and light,
Where the language of the machine takes flight,
There dwells a coder, wise and bright,
Crafting lines of logic, ever so tight.

With keystrokes deft, a symphony unfolds,
A dance of zeros and ones, a story untold,
Through loops and functions, new worlds are made,
In the endless expanse of the digital glade.

Brilliant minds, with algorithms in hand,
Weave webs of code across the land,
Solving problems, big and small,
With precision and finesse, they conquer all.

So here's to the coders, the ones who dare,
To dream, to create, to craft with care,
In the language of silicon, they find their art,
And code their way straight to the heart.
